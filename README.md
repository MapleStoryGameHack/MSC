Continuation of MSB.

- This trainer was meant to work for majority of the MapleStory regions by utilizing 'bypassless hacking'.
- BlackCipher has updated on 05/08/14 and has detected MSC; therefore, the project is now cancelled.

Due to this unexpected occurance, I have decided to open source my project and to focus on school.

- This project was close to release for the Global MapleStory region.
- The cancellation means that the: login logic, legitbot logic, and script logic is not coded within the MSC project.

Shout-outs to;

- CheatEngine 
- GameKiller
- Yaminike
- L L
- Alex
- Chubbz

Enjoy.
