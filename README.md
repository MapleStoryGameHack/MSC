Successor of MSB.

- This trainer was meant to work for majority of the MapleStory regions by utilizing 'bypassless hacking'.
- BlackCipher has updated on 05/08/14 and has detected MSC; therefore, the project is now cancelled.

Due to this unexpected occurance, I have decided to open source my project and to focus on school.

- This project was close to release for the Global MapleStory region, rest was to be announced.
- The cancellation means that the: login logic, legitbot logic, and script logic is not included within the MSC project.

Different methods and everything else that is currently not included will eventually be pushed as seperate projects later.

Shout-outs to;

- CheatEngine 
- Yaminike

Enjoy.
